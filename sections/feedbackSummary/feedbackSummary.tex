The summary of the feedback from each of the three peers is summarized below, along with the actions I chose to take given the feedback.

The feedback from the first peer mentioned some errors with grammar and sentence flow.
They annotated the report to point out these errors, most of which I agreed with and fixed.
One comment I did not agree with is that the reviewer mentioned not capitalizing the word Internet in the Introduction and Background section, where I write ``the Internet''.
I argue that this should be capitalized because I am referring to the Internet as a proper noun, not as an adjective.

The reviewer also noted that I did not include a List of Figures section, so I added that.
